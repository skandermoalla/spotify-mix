To get your Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret), follow these steps:
Step-by-Step Process

    Log In to the Spotify Developer Dashboard:
        Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
        Log in with your Spotify account (or create a new one if you don’t have an account).

    Create a New App:
        Once logged in, click on the Create an App button.
        Fill in the required details for your app:
            App Name: You can choose any name, e.g., "Playlist Mixer".
            App Description: Describe your app (e.g., "Mixes two Spotify playlists").
        Agree to the Spotify Developer Terms.
        Click on Create.

    Select API/SDKs:
        On the next page (which is what you showed in your screenshot), select Web API. This allows you to interact with Spotify’s core functionality such as playlists, tracks, and user data.

    Add a Redirect URI:
        Scroll down and add a Redirect URI. You can use http://localhost:8888/callback if you are working on a local machine, as this is a common redirect for local development. The redirect URI is needed for OAuth authorization.
        Save your changes.

    Get Your Client ID and Client Secret:
        After creating the app, you’ll be taken to the app’s dashboard.
        Here, you will see your Client ID immediately.
        To get your Client Secret, click on the Show Client Secret button.

    Store Your Credentials:
        Store these credentials safely, as you will need them in your Python code to authenticate with the Spotify API.
